.SH DESCRIPTION
Hyenae is a highly flexible and platform independent network packet generator.
It allows you to reproduce low level ethernet attack scenarios (such as MITM,
DoS and DDoS) to reveal the potential security vulnerabilities of your
network. Besides smart wildcard-based address randomization and a highly
customizable packet generation control, Hyenae comes with a clusterable remote
daemon for setting up distributed attack networks.

Hyenae was developed with ease of use in mind while still remaining flexible
and configurable. To realize this aim, Hyenae uses address patterns, which
will minimize the number of arguments you have to provide because all
necessary parameters, such as the way you want to randomize your addresses or
the IP address version to use, can be derived from the pattern format you
provided. See section 4, "Address Patterns", for more detailed information.

This utility suite was developed for network reliability testing purposes such
as firewall rules, flood detection and intrusion detection testing only. The
author is not responsible for any illegal use or actions, or damage caused by
or with a utility of this suite.

.SH OPTIONS
\fB-i\fR    Network interface to attack on
      (specified by name). This will not set
      the network interface on which to
      listen for connections.

\fB-I\fR    Network interface to attack on
      (specified by index). This will not
      set the network interface on which to
      listen for connections. A list of all
      available network interfaces and their
      indices can be obtained by starting
      Hyenae with the -l option.

\fB-a\fR    IP address to bind the daemon's
      server socket to. The default value is
      127.0.0.1 (localhost). The Hyenae
      Daemon can not be bound to the network
      interface you want to attack from.

\fB-p\fR    The port number on which the
      daemon shall listen for incoming
      connections. By default the daemon
      will listen on port 666.

\fB-b\fR    Number of backlog connections
      the daemon shall handle. The default
      value 5.

\fB-t\fR    Trusted IP address list.
      Specifies an IP list file which will
      be used as a trusted list of IP
      addresses. If set, only clients using
      the specified IP addresses will be
      allowed to connect to the daemon. An
      IP address list has the following
      format:

        # Comment
        IP-Address=[IP-Address]
        IP-Address=[IP-Address]
        ...

      Wildcards are not valid within IP
      address list files.

\fB-T\fR    Untrusted IP address list.
      Specifies an IP list file which will
      be used as a list of untrusted IP
      addresses. If set, all clients using
      the specified IP addresses will not be
      able to connect to the daemon. An IP
      address list has the following format:

        # Comment
        IP-Address=[IP-Address]
        IP-Address=[IP-Address]
        ...

      Wildcards are not valid within IP
      address list files.

\fB-A\fR    IP version the listening socket
      shall use. This can be either 4 or 6.
      The default version is 4 (IPv4).

\fB-c\fR    Packet limit for clients.
      Specifies the maximum number of
      packets a single client can request to
      attack with. If not set or set to 0,
      you must specify an attack duration
      limit.

\fB-u\fR    Attack duration limit for
      clients. Specifies the maximum number
      of milliseconds a single client can
      request to attack for. If not set or
      set to 0, you must specify a packet
      limit.

\fB-C\fR    Maximum number of clients
      allowed to connect. The default value
      is 10.

\fB-k\fR    Password protection. If set,
      only clients which are using this
      password will be able to control this
      daemon. Note: Since Hyenae currently
      does not support encrypted
      communication, your password is
      transfered in plain text, and can be
      logged by others.

\fB-f\fR    Log-File path. By default, all
      daemon logs will be written to
      /var/log/hyenaed.log on *nix systems
      or .\\hyenaed.log on windows systems.

\fB-l\fR    Prints a list of all available
      network interfaces and exits.

\fB-V\fR    Prints the current version of
      Hyenae and exits.
